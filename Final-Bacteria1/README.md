HELLO ZACH,
For my final I tried to simulate bacteria growth. I have made multiple applications since I was not able to change the drawing mode on the same sketch and I wanted to show different types of bacteria.

For my next steps I would like to incorporate a user interface where one can play with the reproduction and death rate of every particle (bacteria cell). I would also try to draw all the different types of bacteria in one sketch, different draws and let the user toggle between them.

Thanks,
Navit
